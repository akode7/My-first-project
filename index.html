    <h3> How to play</h3>
<p> Pong :
    Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other
    Snake game :
    In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
    Guess My Number :
    To play Guess My Number, the Ai thinks of a secret number within a given range and the other person tries to guess it. After each guess, the guesser is told whether the secret number is greater or less than their guess. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible
    Tetris :
    Tetris begins with an empty screen, and requires the player to fit falling blocks together like a puzzle. There are seven shapes composed of four blocks each, and they fall into the space one at a time at a fixed speed. The player's goal is to rotate the shapes as they fall to complete solid rows without gaps.
    Tic - Tac - Toe :
    You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O . Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
